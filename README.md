# Photo-Editor

https://github.com/JonathanSCasper/Photo-Editor

Description: This program finds all JPEG photos in the user's Pictures folder and displays them in a window. The user can change the viewing size of the photos, as well as edit each photo individually by changing the brightness, color, and even inverting the image!

Known bugs: Saving file doesn't work -- it was being used by another process.
            Cancel button doesn't work

Extra Credit: TreeView has folder icons & used a Splitter control to allow the tree view and list view to be resized
